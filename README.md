# Final-Project

For this project i am basically using canvas to be able to changes this colors of the board by clicking anywhere on the page.
I was inspired while on w3schools a function where i was able to change colors of text by clicking a button, so i looked up were there ways to do this using canvas anf changing the colors on a screen instead of the text. I also had otgher ideas of having it more interactive and seen somethat were really cool, however i found them to be kind of complicated.
